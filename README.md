# SimplyShopApp
Simple shop application made for recruiting process, a company asked me to create a simple app to see how I code. 

********************************************
Concept:
We would like you to create a simple Shopping list app where you can create new shopping list and add items to buy. 

Requirements:
App should consist of three views:
list of current shopping lists
list of archived shopping lists
shopping list details where you can add/delete items etc. Please notice that those operations  should be only possible when list isn’t archived.
Use simple SQLite database to store apps’ data.
Lists should be sorted by date.
Please follow Android Design Principles (http://developer.android.com/design/index.html)
Target your app to Jelly Bean 4.2+
